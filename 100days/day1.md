# Day 1 
Note: this won't be so detailed as I didn't write this on the original day I began
## Learnt about haskell and what it is
- It's purely functional language.
- It's statically typed.
- It has type interference.
- Is elegant and concise and so is usually shorter than imperative code.
- Is lazy so won't run or execute anything unless told to.

## Understood core concepts of a purely functional programming language such as:
- No side effects.
- Referential transparency - if a function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the same result.

## How to get started
- Using chocolatey on Windows according to the official [guide](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) to run `choco install haskell-dev haskell-stack` and then `refreshenv`
- Editor: I'm using VSCode
- Run interactive mode in command line/git bash by typing `ghci`
- Example file called `myfunctions.hs` can be loaded and run using `:l myfunctions.hs`
- Use `:r` to reload the current script
