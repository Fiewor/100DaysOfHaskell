# Day 4 - More on Lists!

- Find an element at a particular index using `!!`

```haskell
ghci> "John Fiewor" !! 7
'e'
```
- Lists can contain other lists and the lists within a list can be of different lengths but they can't be of different types.
- Lists can be compared using the comparison operators i.e. `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=`
- COmparison is in lexicographical order. First the heads are compared. If they are equal then the second elements are compared

There are also a ton of basic functions that operate on lists
